*A source code file contains code as written in whatever language the programmer is using.An object code file contabs machine language code;
it need not be the code for a complete program.An executable file contains the complete code,in machine language,constituting an excutable program.*

    - Defining the program.
    - Desinging the program.
    - Coding the program.
    - Compiling the program.
    - Running the program
    - Testing and debugging the program.
    - Maintaining and modifying the program.

4. What does a compiler do?

*A compiler translates source code (for example,code written in C)to the equivalent
machine language code,also termed object code.*

5. What does a linker do?

*The linker conbines translated source code with library code and start-up code to produce an executable program.*
